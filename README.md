# 🧠 Intelligent Alert Escalation & Resolution System  
### Developed by **Thirunagari Sri Kumar**

---

## 📘 Introduction
The **Intelligent Alert Escalation & Resolution System** automates the lifecycle of alerts generated by multiple modules such as **Safety, Compliance, and Feedback**.  
It intelligently escalates, de-escalates, and auto-closes alerts based on configurable rules—reducing manual intervention and improving operational efficiency.

---

## 🏗️ System Overview
The system centralizes alert management by ingesting alerts from multiple sources through REST APIs.  
It employs:
- A **rule engine** for dynamic escalation logic  
- **Background workers** for auto-closure  
- A **React dashboard** for real-time visualization  

Designed for **scalability**, **fault tolerance**, and **modular architecture**.
